      doc: The smallest possible difference between two spike times. Usually 1 divided
        by the acquisition sampling rate from which spike times were extracted, but
        could be larger if the acquisition time series was downsampled or smaller
        if the acquisition time series was smoothed/interpolated and it is possible
        for the spike time to be between samples.
